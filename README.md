Returning to the homepage, all projects are listed, each accompanied by a button. Clicking this button reveals a project summary, displaying the number of completed and pending tasks. Additionally, there's another button for a detailed view.

Upon clicking the detailed view button, users are presented with all the to-do details, including the project name, to-do name, description, creation time, and status. Two additional buttons for editing and deleting are available for each to-do, enhancing usability and functionality.
